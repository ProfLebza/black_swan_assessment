# Black Swan Assessment

## Installation
Please note that I am using yarn for my front-end packages. 

Once you have run composer install, don't forget to run :

    * yarn run dev/prod
    * doctrine:migrations:migrate
    * doctrine:fixtures:load

Data fixtures will setup a user along with a token that can be used to access the API

I built something simple and quick so that I can have this assignment sent to you without delay

Please also note that I am using 2 authenticators
